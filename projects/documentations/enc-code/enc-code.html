        <p><strong>enc-code</strong></p>
        <p>`enc` command is a wrapper around your regular version control system (`git`, `svn`, `mercurial` etc.).</p>
        
        <div>
        This command enables encryption and scrambling of repository files, commit messages, author info and
        commit date-time. The code stays decrypted in your local but is pushed
        in encrypted state in the remote repo.</div>
        <div>An enc repo organises code into:</div>
        <p>
        <div>
        1) `working tree stage`: the stage where your code stays pure, unencrypted and/or unscrambled. This is the
        stage where user is supposed to make changes and perform usual git operations by using the 'enc' command instead
        of the 'git' command. Users can set a trusted repository location to push this pure code into, this is not
        required though.</div>
        <div>
        2) `process stage`: the stage where everything in the code is processed, encrypted and/or scrambled. This stage is
        configured so that processed code can be pushed to the remote untrusted repository.</div></p>

        <div>
                > Note: `enc` command needs bash emulator to run on windows, e.g. `git-bash`. This requirement is almost always
        </div> 
        <div>
                > satisfied by `git` on windows.
        </div>

        <div>
                > Note: The Majority of git commands are supported
        </div>
