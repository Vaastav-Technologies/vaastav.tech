# enc-cli-help

This document explains the user how to use the enc cli for testing as well as running commands directly in venv.

Rules:
1) The string in {} will be treated for interpolation, for e.g. `{key_file}`. These are case-sensitive.
    Following interpolation strings are supported:
    - `non_existing_process_stage`: Will give path to a temporary process-stage but not actually materialize it.
    - `gen_non_existing_process_stage`: Will give path to a non-materialised temporary process-stage generated by a generator and hence will be unique.
    - `process_stage`: Will give path to a materialized temporary process-stage.
    - `gen_process_stage`: Will give path to a materialized temporary process-stage generated by a generator and hence will be unique.
    - `non_existing_working_tree`: Will give path to a temporary working-tree but not actually materialize it.
    - `gen_non_existing_working_tree`: Will give path to a generated non-materialised temporary working-tree.
    - `working_tree`: Will give path to a materialized temporary working-tree.
    - `gen_working_tree`: Will give path to a generated materialized temporary working-tree.
    - `non_existing_key_file`: A temporary newly un-generated key file.
    - `key_file`: A temporary newly generated key file.
    - `non_existing_dummy_file`: A temporary newly un-generated dummy file.
    - `dummy_file`: A temporary newly generated dummy file.
